🎯 Goals & Focus Areas  

🧠 Full Stack Web Development  
I enjoy working across the full stack, from backend APIs to frontend interfaces.  
Current focus areas include:

- Backend development with .NET (C#) and REST APIs  
- Frontend development with React + Vite  
- Authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth)  
- Relational and NoSQL databases  

📊 Data & Quality-Oriented Systems  
Through my experience at TVN, I’ve worked with:

- ETL processes using Python and SQL  
- Data quality validation and traceability  
- Dashboards and KPIs using Looker Studio  

This reinforced my interest in building reliable systems where data accuracy matters.
